    <h3>21. Miller's Planet</h3>
    <center><img src="pics/21.png" alt="11" width="50%"></center>
    <p>Because Miller's planet is orbiting the black hole, time passes on it so slowly that 1 hour on it is 7 years on Earth.
    It's suggested that Miller's planet is a water planet with no land.  The immense gravity of the black hole causes massive tidal waves as tall as 4,000 feet.</p>
    <p>Astronomers found evidence that two exoplanets orbiting a star 218 light-years away are water worlds,  where water makes up a large fraction of the entire planet.</p>
    <p>One fun fact about this scene, you can hear a ticking sound every 1.25 seconds. Each tick represents a whole day passing on Earth. </p>

    <h3>22. The Faulty Equation</h3>
    <center><img src="pics/22.jpg" alt="11" width="50%"></center>
    <p>Murph notices Professor Brand's gravity equation doesn't make sense, as they never tried to solve it without
      changing the undelying assumption about time. And in order to change that, they must collect data from the black hole's singularity (a region of infinite density at its center),
       which is impossible. She calls it recursive, as each iteration is trying to prove its proof.</p>
    <p>Recursion is the process that has one of its steps invoking the process itself.</p>

    <h3>23. Frozen Clouds</h3>
    <center><img src="pics/23.png" alt="11" width="50%"></center>
    <p>Ice clouds, forming at extremely cold temperatures, made of ice crystals are called "Cirrus Clouds". These droplets or crystals are so small and light that they can remain suspended in the air even in very cold temperatures.
    Indicating, they don't freeze and fall from the sky.</p>

    <h3>24. Mann's Planet</h3>
    <center><img src="pics/24.jpg" alt="11" width="50%"></center>
    <p>Mann's planet is an ice planet that also orbits the black hole. The closest things to it that we know of are Uranus and Neptune, which are known as "Ice Giants",
    as 80% of their masses are made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane, and ammonia – above a small, rocky core. </p>
    <p>However, for a planet to be made entirely from ice is unlikely. It is possible for it to be covered in ice.</p>

    <h3>25. "don't go gentle with that good night"</h3>
    <center><img src="pics/25.jpg" alt="11" width= "30%"></center>
    <p>The phrase Professor Brand keeps repeating throughout the movie is the name of a poem by Dylan Thomas.
    The meaning behind that phrase is that life is precious and should be fought for at every turn. Check this link to read the poem.</p>

    <h3>26. Cooper adjusting his head in the opposite direction of the spin</h3>
    <center><img src="pics/26.png" alt="11" width= "50%"></center>
    <p>During the docking scene, Cooper pushes his head in the opposite direction of the spin, unlike Amelia, which results in her blacking out and not him.</p>
    <p>That's because adjusting your head against the rotation prevents the blood from leaving the brain.</p>

    <h3>27. Power Sling Shot</h3>
    <center><img src="pics/27.png" alt="11" width="40%"></center>
    <p>The technique Cooper is applying in this scene is known as "gravity assist". It makes use of the gravity of a planet or other astronomical object to alter
    the path and speed of a spacecraft to save fuel. Cooper applies this concept with the black hole itself to reach Edmund's planet.</p>

    <h3>28. Newton's Third Law</h3>
    <center><img src="pics/28.jpg" alt="11" width></center>
    <p>For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. That's what most of us know it by, but in the movie Cooper mentions it and says "the only way humans have ever figured out of getting somewhere is to leave something behind".
    If you walk from one place to another, you leave behind energy. If you drive the distance, you leave behind fuel. So your action here is your motion to the desired place, and the reaction is what you left behind.</p>

    <h3>29. The 5th Dimension</h3>
    <center><img src="pics/29.png" alt="11" width="50%"></center>
    <p>Now realistically, Cooper should have died when he entered the black hole. But because it's science fiction, the beings who placed the wormhole have constructed a gateway to a higher
    dimension (The Tesseract). They made an infinite, endless array of 3-dimensional “snapshots” of Murph’s past, for Cooper to be able to communicate with Murph via gravity (which transcends all dimensions). Indicating what Amelia said earlier that
  to the bulk beings, time is a physical thing.</p>

    <h3>30. Love transcends Time and Space</h3>
  <center><img src="pics/30.png" alt="11" width="50%"></center>
  <p>This is the central theme of the movie  that explores the power of human connection and emotion beyond the confines of traditional physics and scientific understanding. The concept of love as another dimension in "Interstellar" suggests the idea that human emotions and relationships are integral to our understanding of the universe and our place within it.
    </p>
    <p>It suggests that there may be aspects of reality that cannot be explained by conventional scientific principles alone, and that love and emotional connections might hold a significance that extends beyond our current understanding.</p>
    <h3>31. Solving the Gravity Equation</h3>
    <center><img src="pics/31.jpg" alt="11" width="40%"></center>
    <p>Murph gets the quantum data to complete the gravity equation. She is able to understand how to harness gravity, and how to control it, so that humanity is able to leave Earth.</p>
    <p>In Kip Thorne's book "The Science of Interstellar", he mentions that for people to be able to leave Earth after solving the equation, a huge force must have been exerted on the planet causing tremendous damage to it.
    It's a harsh reality, but the price that had to be paid to save humanity.</p>
