    <h2>How to Create a Wormhole</h2>

    <h5>A wormhole is thought to be a portal from one point in the universe to another. According to
      the general theory of relativity, their existence is possible but so far none have been discovered.
    </h5>
    <h5>So it's not actually possible to create a wormhole on Earth. However, this article shows
    how a wormhole is formed and if it's possible to create, how it would be done.</h5>
    <p>Step 1: We need a black hole. If you don't know how a black hole is created, check out this article below.</p>

    <p>A black hole is created when the gravitational attraction is so big, nothing can get out, not even light. Anything with
    big enough mass creates a curvature on the fabric of space and time. The theory behind wormholes suggests that
  what if that mass got large enough to tear the fabric and connect to another point in the universe.</p>
  <h4>The Einstein-Rosen Bridge</h4>

  </div>
  <p>In 1935, Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen suggested the idea of the "White Hole" -the polar opposite of a black hole- who's event horizons work in reverse.
     If nothing can get out of the black hole, then nothing can get inside a white hole
  and anything present inside the white hole when it forms will quickly be expelled outwards faster than the speed of light.</p>
  <p>Now if we connected a black hole and a white hole together, we reach a tunnel through space-time connecting 2 points in the universe.
  Einstein and Rosen called it "The Einstein-Rosen Bridge". The only problem is that the tunnel would be extremely unstable and would tend
to collapse because gravity is trying to close it down, crushing anything that passes through it. </p>

<h4>The Morris-Throne Bridge</h4>
<p>In 1988, Michael Morris and Kip Thorne presented the idea that in order to make the wormhole stable and traversable we need what's
called "Exotic Matter" which is a substance with negative mass. As positive masses are attracted towards each other by gravity, a
negative mass will repel. So exotic matter will act as "anti-gravity" that will hold the wormhole open without it collapsing on itself.
</p>

<p>The problem is it would require a huge amount of exotic matter to be able to do this, however the exotic matter has only been observed in small
amounts found in places with very high pressures and high temperatures such as the interior of stars and planets, and even if a large amount of it
was found, we are not sure how we'll be able to collect it and use it.</p>
