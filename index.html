      <h4>Interstellar, an emotional heartfelt story about space exploration,
        was directed by Christopher Nolan in 2014. Set in a dystopian future where life on Earth is about to end, the film sees Cooper's journey to save humanity. </h4>
      <h4 class="text">This article will explain every scientific concept, fact, or theory presented in the movie, scene by scene. Hope you learn something new by the end. "SPOILER ALERT".</h4>
      <h3>1. The Movie's Name</h3>
      <p>The name "Interstellar" means in between stars. The area inside a galaxy is often referred to by astronomers as interstellar space.</p>

      <p>The movie begins with Cooper dreaming of a crash that happened previously to him due to a gravitational anomaly. What he's experiencing during that sequence is called in aviation a "Death Spiral" or "Graveyard Spiral". It's when the
        pilot loses control over the plane causing it to descend towards to land in a spiral motion.<p>
          <p>Some people have pointed a fun theory that if this crash didn't happen, Cooper would have been sent to one of the 12 planets,
        he wouldn't have entered the Tesseract nor have fathered to Murph; thus, save humanity.
       </p>

       <h3>3. The Blight</h3>
       <center><img src="pics/3.jpg" alt="0"width="50%"></center>
       <p>The "Blight" is a plague that destroyed all plants on Earth. A "Blight" is the disease or injury of plants causing browning and chlorosis of plant tissues. In the movie, the plague affected all types of plants except corn as the only
       viable food source.</p>
       <p>As Blight thrives on Nitrogen, the air gets less Oxygen leaving people on earth to suffocate. The progressive deforestation and desertification of the planet caused dust storms. </p>

        <h3>4. Murphy's Law</h3>

     </div>
       <p>In this scene, Murph asks her dad why he named her after Murphy's law. Murphy’s law, created by Edward A. Murphy Jr., states that “Anything that can go wrong will go wrong”.
       Like for example, if bread fell on the floor it will fall with the butter side down or it will rain after you wash your car.</p>

      <p>It is a law that is meant to teach us to prepare for all outcomes.  Cooper tells Murph the law means that whatever can happen will happen.</p>

        <h3>5. The Indian Surveillance Drone</h3>
      <center><img src="pics/5.jpg" alt="0"width="50%"></center>
      <p>A drone flies above the farmland which has enough solar cells to power the entire farm.
      Cooper hacks and takes control of an Indian Air Force drone by sending a Morse code message through the drone's feedback mechanism.
    </p>
    <p>In reality, the hacking method portrayed in the movie is highly fictional and not representative of how hacking drones typically works in real life. Hacking a drone from the ground,
    especially a military-grade drone, is not as simple as sending a Morse code message or using a feedback mechanism to take control.
      </p>
      <p>Surveillance drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), are cutting-edge unmanned aircraft equipped with advanced sensors and cameras to gather information about specific targets like individuals, groups, or the environment.</p>

      <p>In this scene, Cooper is arguing with the school principle as she claims the apollo missions were faked to bankrupt the soviet union.
      There are a lot of conspiracy theories about the moon landing being faked and they were all debunked multiple times.</p>
      <p>This is one that states that NASA faked the moon landing to motivate the Soviet Union to engage in the Space Race and thus bankrupt it.</p>

      <h3>7. Morse Code</h3>

      <p>Murph thinks her ghost is trying to send her a message by how the dust is formed. She encodes the message by morse code.
         If you don't know about Morse Code, it's basically a method used in telecommunication to represent text characters using only two signal durations, dots and dashes (.,_), or dits and dahs. It's named after Samuel F.B. Morse who created it to transmit messages across telegraph wires in the 1830s.
      </p>
      <p>One of the most famous incidents in relation to Morse was Jeremiah Denton, who was a U.S. Senator held captive during Vietnam War. He was forced to participate in a 1966 televised propaganda interview which was broadcast in the United States. While answering questions and feigning trouble with the blinding television lights, Denton blinked his eyes in Morse code,
       spelling the word "T-O-R-T-U-R-E" to confirm to U.S. Naval Intelligence that American POWs were being tortured.</p>

        <h3>8. Binary</h3>

       <p>Cooper finally believes Murph's story about the ghost message, but says they are not morse but binary code. "Binary Code" is a computer code that consists of 1s and 0s. These numbers form the basic layer of all computing systems and are the primary language of digital technologies. It was invented by German mathematician Gottfried Leibniz in his article "Explanation of the binary arithmetic".</p>

        <h3>9. TARS</h3>
       <center><img src="pics/9.avif" alt="0"width="50%"></center>
       <p>TARS is one of four tactical robots along with PLEX, CASE and KIPP. A tactical robot is a robot used for information gathering when deployed to potentially hazardous incidents. TARS's design is believed to resemble a star,
       but it's also possibly a reference to Tars Tarkas, the six-limbed Martian friend of John Carter in Edgar Rice Burroughs' Barsoom series.</p>

        <h3>10. The Endurance</h3>
       <div class="img-container">

     </div>
       <p>The Endurance is the spaceship that is used to cross the wormhole.
         It's named after a ship that sailed for the Antarctic in 1912, led by Sir Ernest Shackelton. A year later, the ship was trapped
      in pack ice and sank in the Weddell Sea off Antarctica in 1915.</p>
         <p>The Endurance is centrifugal, meaning it spins around its axis to create artificial gravity. Just like when you spin a bucket full of water so fast over your head, centrifugal force acts to push the water toward the edge.
       </p>
       <p>This allows the crew to walk normally on the ship instead of floating and maintains their physical health, as it helps prevent negative effects from prolonged weightlessness. The circular design provides better structural integrity and stability, as it distributes the stresses more evenly throughout the spacecraft.</p>
