    <h5>A Black hole is an area in space of immense gravitational attraction that even light can not escape from it, hence the black color.</h5>
    <h4><em>~Spoiler Alert~</em></h4>
    <h5>It's not actually possible to create a black hole at home or anywhere on Earth. However, this article
      illustrates how a black hole is formed and if it's possible to be created here how it would be done.</h5>
      <h5>So, grab your lab coat and your imagination, and let's embark on this cosmic journey — just for fun!</h5>
      <h4><u>Shrinking Earth to the size of a marble</u></h4>
      <div class="imgContainer">

      <p>OK.. wanna create a black hole at home? Easy, all you have to do is shrink the entire Earth into the size
      of a marble. Afterwards, there probablly would be no home. Shrinking Earth like that while keeping its mass the same would provide sufficient
    energy to initiate the creation process of a black hole.</p>
    <p>Newton's "Inverse Square Law" states that the observed "intensity" of a specified physical quantity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of that physical quantity.
    This means the gravitational attraction force between two point masses is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separation distance.</p>
    <div class="imgContainer">
    <img src="pics/2.png" alt="2">
    </div>
    <p>If the Earth were to shrink but keep the same mass, the density of the planet would increase dramatically
    causing increased gravity due Earth's radius decreasing, and we're only talking shrinking the planet by a relatively small scale and not to a size of a marble.</p>
    <h4><u>Increased Gravity</u></h4>
    <p>Increased gravity would cause increased atmospheric pressure, as the atmosphere is held in place by Earth's gravity. This could make it difficult to breathe for humans and other animals.
    Increased atmospheric pressure and heat would cause increased volcanic activity, causing earthquakes and tsunamis.</p>

    <p>Eventhough life on Earth is probablly dead by that point, we haven't reached the level of the black hole yet.
    If Earth were to shrink too much, it could potentially collapse into a black hole.</p>

    <p>But how does a black hole form? A black hole is formed by the death of a supermassive star. Inside a star's core, the dominant energy production process is "the fusion reaction".
    The star fuses 2 hydrogen atoms into a helium atom. 2 hygrogen atoms have the same positive charge they want to repell each other. Getting them close to each other to fuse requires a large amount
  of heat and pressure generated by gravity. The sun, for instance, contains 99% of all the matter in the solar system, all that mass pulls the sun together with immense gravitational attraction.</p>

  <img src="pics/4.png" alt="4">
  </div>
  <p>With gravity crushing all that matter down bringing hydrgen atoms close enough together to fuse into helium. When the protons come together they lose some mass, and that mass gets converted to energy.
  The star eventually runs out of hydrogen for the fusion process; therefore, starts fusing helium into beryllium and then carbon. It keeps fusing heavier until it reaches Iron.
Once the core has turned to iron, it can burn no longer. The star collapses by its own gravity and the iron core heats up causing a supernova.</p>
<p>Finally, the black hole can be formed, but not by any star's death, only a supermassive one. So not even the sun can create a black hole after it dies, because it's too small to create such energy and is considered a "dwarf star".
Scientists suspect there may be as many as a 100 million black holes in the "Milky Way" alone.</p>
<h4><u>The Large Hadron Collider</u></h4>

<p>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator. A particle accelerator is a machine that speeds up charged particles into a beam to make them collide
together or at a target. This allows scientists to study those particles and the forces that shape them.</p>
<p>Some theories suggest that the formation of tiny 'quantum' black holes may be possible using the LHC, however it's not possibe in the cosmological sense.</p>
