    <h3>11. Gravitational Anomaly - "tripped my fly by wire"</h3>
    <center><img src="pics/11.jpg" alt="11"width="50%"></center>
    <p>Gravity anomalies are often due to unusual concentrations of mass in a region. For instance, the presence of mountain ranges in an area would cause the gravity at that area to be higher than that of the same area without the mountains.
    In 2009, NASA sent the mission known as "GRACE" (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) to precisely measure the gravity on every part of our planet. You can check NASA's simulation "Eyes on the Earth" that displays the data about this.</p>
    <a href="https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/earth/#/">"https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/earth/#/"></a>
    <p>In the movie, NASA discovered a disturbance of space and time within the orbit of Saturn. This gravitational anomaly was what caused the crash that happened to Cooper.
      This anomaly was discovered to be a wormhole.</p>
    <h3>12. The Wormhole</h3>
    <div class="img-container">

  </div>
    <p>A wormhole is basically a tunnel from one place in space to another. Now  if the mass of an object becomes large enough, the other forces of nature besides gravity can’t support the matter, and it becomes a black hole. Theoretically, if the curvature is extreme enough to connect 2 points in space-time, now you have a wormhole. As of now, no wormholes to be found, but the
    movie suggests that one has been found near Saturn. Since wormholes are not naturally occurring phenomena, the scientists in the movie suggest that it was placed by unknown beings.</p>

    <p>Wormholes were first theorized in 1916 by Austrian physicist Ludwig Flamm after reviewing Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. In 1935, Einstein and physicist Nathan Rosen proposed the existence of bridges through space-time.
     The shortcuts came to be called Einstein-Rosen bridges, or wormholes.</p>

      <h3>13. Hibernation</h3>
     <center><img src="pics/13.webp" alt="11"width="50%"></center>
     <p>Space hibernation would allow astronauts to snooze their way through a long space trip, in order to save effort and resources. As of right now, There's no clear path to human hibernation, or any guarantee that it's possible. That's because the human body is full of water, if you freeze the human tissue, the water expands and ruptures the cell membrane causing
     irreparable damage.</p>
     <p>An interesting possibility is something called "Torpor State". Basically, you lower the body temperature to 32°C and thereby significantly reducing metabolic rates. This can be applied for around 2 weeks.</p>
     <p>Another solution is to replace all the water in the cells with antifreeze fluid, a process that's called "Vitrification". However, it's unclear how to preserve the brain due to its density. Moreover, no-one has been revived after being vitrified.</p>
      <h3>14. Plan A</h3>
     <center><img src="pics/14.png" alt="11"width="50%"></center>
     <p>Plan A was for the crew to find a new planet, while Professor Brand works on solving the gravity equation to be able to propel spaceships loaded with people of the planet. More on that later when Murph solved the equation.

    <h3>15. Plan B</h3>
     <center><img src="pics/15.png" alt="11"width="50%"></center>
     <p>Plan B's aim to save humanity as species not the actual people. The crew would reach the new planet carrying a "population bomb" of 5000 cryogenically frozen fertilized eggs with enough resources to create a self-sustaining colony.</p>
     <p>The process to do that is known as "In Vitro Fertilization" (IVF), where mature eggs are collected from ovaries and fertilized by sperm in a lab. Then the procedure is to take the fertilized embryo and implant in a uterus to grow naturally.</p>

      <h3>16. Rocket Launch</h3>
     <center><img src="pics/16.png" alt="11"width="50%"></center>
     <p>In this scene, we see the Endurance finally taking off from Earth. Rocket Launching involves several steps that differ from one rocket type to another, however most orbital rockets follow a similar procedure during a launch sequence.
     </p>
     <p>After the rocket gains enough speed and altitude, the separation of the rocket happens with MECO (Main Engines Cut Off), First Stage Separation, Second Stage Ignition and SECO (Second Engine Cut Off). </p>
     <p>More about that here.</p>

      <h3>17. Dramamine</h3>
     <center><img src="pics/17.jpg" alt="11"width="30%"></center>
     <p>Dramamine is a medicine that treats motion sickness symptoms like nausea and vomiting, The scientists use it to treat motion sickness from the spinning of the Endurance.</p>
     <p>It works by inhibiting the vestibular system, which is responsible for our sense of balance and spatial orientation.</p>

      <h3>18. "best sailor in the world doesn't know how to swim"</h3>

     <p>Cooper says that sentence to comfort Romily who's scared about the void they're separated against by a piece of metal. Here Cooper is probably referring to Joshua Slocum,
     the first man to ever make a solo trip around the world (1898-1901), but never learned how to swim.</p>
     <p>The man, ironically, disappeared in the sea many years after completing his trip and was legally declared dead in 1924.</p>

      <h3>19. Gargantua - The Black Hole</h3>
     <center><img src="pics/19.jpg" alt="11" width="50%"></center>
     <p>The very massive rapidly spinning black hole in the movie is named "Gargantua", the name of a voracious giant in Rabelais' book in the late 16th century.</p>
     <p>The black hole is an area of such immense gravity that nothing—not even light—can escape from it. Scientists claim there may be around a 100 million black holes in the Milky Way.</p>
     <p>In Kip Thorne's book, The Science of Interstellar, he mentions that Gargantua does not have a jet or a superheated blue accretion disk, indicating it has probably not devoured a star in millions of years.</p>
      <h3>20. Theory of Relativity</h3>

     <p>The principle that has been the main motif of the emotional package in the movie. From the 7 years per hour on Miller's to Cooper watching his kids grow in seconds, the main idea behind such a unique plot like that is the Theory of Relativity.
     Albert Einstein's theory predicts that where gravity is stronger, time passes more slowly.
   </p>
   <p>That's because the force of gravity slows down the frequency of atoms. Imagine you're on a spaceship above a black hole.
     You are on the ship observing the black hole, while your colleague gets out and falls into the black hole. From his perspective, his speed will keep increasing until he gets spaghettified. But from your perspective, you'll witness him slowing down and slowing down
   as he is descending into the black hole until a point where he completely stops moving. His final image will take light years if not forever to reach you. </p>
